### Core System Requirements

### Results:

1. **Plan** the iteration and decide on a test
2. **Develop** whatever there is to develop
3. **Run in Operations** using a one-click installer
4. **Test** the test decided previously
5. **Document** in README.md

All components interact with a *git repository*.
